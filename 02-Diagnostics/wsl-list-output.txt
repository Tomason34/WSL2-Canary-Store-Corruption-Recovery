PS C:\WINDOWS\system32> wsl -l -v
  NAME          STATE           VERSION
* kali-linux    Stopped         2



### Interpretation

The presence of `kali-linux` confirmed the distro filesystem remained intact.
The failure was therefore not a destructive unregistration event.
The issue was isolated to the WSL platform or Store packaging layer.
